			<p> <big> Aside from being in the Huskie Marching Band, I am also a third year Computer Science major at NIU. 
			I have always had an interest in computers, and electronics in general, and I've always wanted to learn more 
			about them, and how they work. Which is why I am also currently taking a Web Design class.</big> </p> </br>
