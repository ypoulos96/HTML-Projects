		        <p> <big> I have been to many places around the world, but one of my favorite
			places to go to is Greece. Mostly all of my family lives there, so me and my 
			parents go there every summer to see them. </big> </p>

			<h2 id = "B" style= "text-align: center"> Martial Arts </h2>
			<p> <big> I first started karate when I was just 5 years old, and I earned my black belt 
			when I was 16. Aside from self defense, karate has taught me that anything is
			possible if you put in enough time and effort to reach your goals. </big> </p>

			<h2 id= "C" style= "text-align: center"> Music </h2>
			<p> <big>  I first started learning to play the clarinet all the way back in 3rd grade.
			I stuck with it until my junior year in high school when I switched over to percussion.
			I am currently in the Huskie Marching Band at NIU as member of the drumline and enjoy every
			minute of it. </big> </p>
